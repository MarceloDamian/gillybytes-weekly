### Finding a FOSS Project: Step 2

This week I began to search for open source projects. First, I looked for ones that matched my interests. Unfortunately, there are only very small projects about beauty/makeup/skin care. From this limitation, I decided to broaden my search to popular and beginner-friendly projects. I have looked at the projects listed below and have categorized them as follows:

#### Eliminated Projects
* [Folly](https://github.com/facebook/folly): I do not find this project exciting or interesting.
* [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp): About 93% of this project is written in Javascript, which is a language I am not familiar with. My lack of proficiency would limit the contributions I could make to the project.
* [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node): Although this project has a history and reputation for being welcoming to new open source contributors, it is also primarily written in Javascript. 

#### Candidates
* [Django](https://github.com/django/django): Django has a welcoming and active community. It also has comprehensive documentation for contributing to the project.
* [Inkscape](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape): The second project I found that aligned with my interests. It is also mostly written in C++, which is one of my preferred languages.
* [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter): The first project I found that matched one of my interests. I first learned about Jupyter Notebooks from my manager who piqued my intest in machine learning and data science. 
* [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip): Zulip has a very active community. There are over 500 contributors merging over 500 commits a month. I also prefer this project because it is primarily written in Python.

#### Promising Projects
* [Inkscape](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape)
* [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter)
* [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip)


In addition to searching for an OSS project, I made three more contributions on OpenStreetMap. I also created mockups for my capstone project with Pencil. I downloaded stencils/collections provided by other contributors. The software is easy to use.

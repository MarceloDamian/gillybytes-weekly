### Why I Elected to Take a Course on Open Source Software

As a Computer Science major, I have often heard the term _open source_ mentioned in my previous classes. From what I gathered, the Open Source Software (OSS) community embraces working together and values providing accessible high-quality products for the mutual benefit of the platform and its users. I chose to take this course because I am an advocate of collaboration and transparency in creating innovative technologies. I want to learn more about OSS and what it has to offer as well as make contributions to the OSS community by taking this course.

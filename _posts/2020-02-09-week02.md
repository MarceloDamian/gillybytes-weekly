### My Open Source Goals

To be an active member of the OSS movement, I plan to contribute to one or more open source projects during the course of this semester. I would like to discover new open source software and explore the features of such technologies. I look forward to engaging in the community by asking questions and discussing new ideas with fellow contributors. I would also like to read existing documentation and learn to write good documentation. Lastly, I hope to test code written by other developers and report any bugs, suggest new features, and provide feedback.

Working in Open Source benefits me other than giving me the satisfaction of making a contribution to a project. Such benefits can be categorized as follows:

* Benefits to My Skills:
  * To sharpen my programming skills
  * Gain knowledge of new tools and technologies
  * Learn how to write clean code, and other best practices
  * Communicate effectively and collaborate with others

* Benefits to My Career:
  * Build an outstanding portfolio
  * Build a reputation as a trusted helper and problem solver
  * Increase job prospects

* Benefits to My Personal Network:
  * Increase community and peer recognition
  * Meet and establish relationships with like-minded people and potential mentors

* Benefits from Preparation:
  * Lifelong learning
  * Keeping myself relevant

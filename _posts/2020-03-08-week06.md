### Contributing to a FOSS Project: Step 1

#### Project Selection: Zulip
Our team chose [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/). Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines the immediacy of real-time chat with an email threading model. We chose Zulip because it is primarily written in Python, which is a language we are all familiar with, and for its welcoming community. This week has been about getting acquainted with the project and its community. I navigated around the repository and spent most of the time reading relevant documentation. My activites for the week are chronicled below:

| Date       | Description |
|---|:---|
|  03/05   |  * Reviewed the class project evaluations <br>  * Narrowed down selection between Zulip and Gatsby <br>  * Team ultimately selected [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) <br>  * Explored the Zulip repository: perused the README and LICENSE files <br>  * Bookmarked the [documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to read for later <br>  * Forked the repository into the class organization  |
|  03/06   |  * Explored the user-facing website of Zulip and downloaded the app for Mac OS <br>  * Created Zulip account <br>  * Navigated through the [documentation](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)  |

### Finding a FOSS Project: Step 1

Now that I've clearly defined my goals and discussed how working on a FOSS project will benefit me, I must find a project to make contributions. I have compiled the following list to narrow my search. I hope to find a project that aligns with at least one of my interests.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things I Find Most Interesting
* Learning about skin care/health and wellness
* Makeup artistry
* Trying out and reviewing beauty products
* Listening to music and podcasts
* Knitting
* Fashion
* Art

In addition to figuring out and classifying my interests, I spent time thinking about skills I possess that would be useful to contributing to a FOSS project. I hope not only to find an intriguing project, but also to share my skills to make meaningful contributions to the project. My Skills are as follows: 
* Adaptable -- ability to work in fast-paced environment
* Detail-oriented
* Effective communicator
* Critical thinker
* Team player
* Maintain positive attitude
* Data Structures
* Web Development
* Programming Languages: C++, Python


This week I began to explore open source software projects.
